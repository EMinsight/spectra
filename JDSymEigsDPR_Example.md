Hello World

This is an example of how to use the Jacobi-Davidson Symmetric Eigenvalue Solver with DPR correction method. This test can also be found as a full file in the [test/JDSymEigsDPR_example.ccp](test/JDSymEigsDPR_example.cpp) file and can be compiled with cmake and run afterwards

```bash
mkdir build && cd build && cmake ../
make JDSymEigsDPR_example
./test/JDSymEigsDPR_example
```
